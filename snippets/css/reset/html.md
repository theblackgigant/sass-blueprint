# html:focus-within

---

Apply smooth scrolling when the page is focused.

!> Don't apply it to the `html` directly since this [interferes](https://css-tricks.com/fixing-smooth-scrolling-with-find-on-page/) with the search on page feature.

## Code

```css
html:focus-within {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```
